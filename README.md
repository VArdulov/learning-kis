# LKIS

This is a reimplementation of the following paper using PyTorch 1.7 

Naoya Takeishi, Yoshinobu Kawahara, and Takehisa Yairi, "Learning Koopman Invariant Subspaces for Dynamic Mode Decomposition," in *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (Proc. of NIPS)*, vol. 30, pp. 1130-1140, 2017.

arXiv preprint: <https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.04340>

## Requirements
This code base was built with the following libraries and environments:
1. `python==3.8.5`
2. `numpy==1.20.0`
3. `scipy==1.6.0`
4. `torch==1.7.1`
5. `pandas==1.2.1`

For visualizations we'll use :
1. `matplotlib==3.3.4`
2. `seaborn==0.11.1`

This environment can be installed easily with the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Files

* `lkis.py`
	- Core implementation of LKIS network.
* `train.py`
	- Script for training network.
* `predict.py`
	- Script for test by prediction based on a trained model.
* `exp_lorenz`
	- Root directory for experiment using Lorenz series. Dataset is included here.
* `matlab/`
	- MATLAB tools.


## Usage

```
python train.py [name] [options]
python predict.py [name] [options]
```

`[name]` specifies the name of the experiment.

### Example

```
python train.py lorenz --numval 1 --delay 7 --dimobs 5
python predict.py lorenz --save
```

The result can be inspected using `matlab/exp_lorenz.m`

## Important options

### train.py

* `--rootdir`
	- Root directory of an experiment. Data and results must be stored under this directory.
* `--datadir`
	- Name of the directory (under the root directory of the experiment) that contains datasets.
* `--outputdir`
	- Name of the directory (under the root directory of the experiment) where results will be stored.
* `--numtrain`
	- Number of training dataset files. If not specified, only one dataset file `train.txt` is used. If specified with 2, for example, `train_0.txt` and `train_1.txt` are used.
* `--numval`
	- Number of validation dataset files. If not specified, no validation dataset is used. If specified with 1, `val.txt` is used. If specified with 2, for example, `val_0.txt` and `val_1.txt` are used.
* `--delay`
	- Dimensionality of delay coordinates. $k$ in the paper.
* `--dimemb`
	- Dimensionality of the delay embedding. $p$ in the paper.
* `--dimobs`
	- Dimensionality of the learned observable. $n$ in the paper.
* `--epoch`
	- Number of epochs for SGD.

### predict.py

* `--numtest`
	- Similar to `--numval`.
* `--horizon`
	- Timestep horizon to which prediction is calculated.
* `--save`
